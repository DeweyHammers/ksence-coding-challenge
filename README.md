# Ksence Coding Challenge

This is my project from Ksence coding challenge.

This is a single page app using vanilla js pulling from a [api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) USERS / POSTS and displaying Users in a table on the screen.

I'm using Classes to hold all the info that I get from the API so I can easily manipulate the data on the DOM.

## To Use The App

Clone done the github Repo and then open up index.html

## Layout

You can click on each user within the table and It will bring up all the posts that belong to that user.

You can filter through the posts to find the one your looking for.
